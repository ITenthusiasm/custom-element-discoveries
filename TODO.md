- [ ] Although we didn't want to... we'll probably want to test `event.defaultPrevented` in order to prove out that our navigation keys for the `CustomSelect` element don't cause any scrolling. If we use Cypress though, we can probably test that the screen scroll location didn't change instead. Maybe that would be better?
- [ ] Add notes about why we need to transfer the `id` of the `custom-select`'s `label`. Basically, the `combobox` widget needs to expose its value via its content if it isn't some kind of input. But including a `listbox` as the `combobox`'s content would be confusing/misleading in that regard ... So, unless we're mistaken, the `listbox` _MUST_ live outside the `combobox`, which means that the `custom-select` element itself cannot have a `role="combobox"`. If we still want the accessible label features (such as click label = click combobox), then we _must_ transfer the `label`'s `for` attribute from the `custom-select` to the `combobox` element. It's a little convoluted, but it seems this is just how it has to be.
  - [ ] On this note, maybe add a "Caveats" note that mentions that `CustomSelect.labels` won't give you the element's labels since we're doing this transfer of `for` thing. If someone wants access to the labels, they'll need to make the `shadowRoot` "open" and use a query selector to access the combobox, which will then allow them to access the combobox's labels... But it's unlikely that access to the labels would be needed ...
    - [ ] **UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE**!!! Why not just set `CustomSelect.get labels` = `this.#combobox.labels`?!? Then the problem is solved! We still make sure the screen readers aren't confused or messed up... but we get the benefit of exposing the `labels` proeprty.
      - [ ] ... **Update** ... This won't work. There are problems with trying to pierce the shadow boundary with `HTMLLabelElements`. See: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3219. For now, we're implementing a rather unorthodox workaround (thanks to `aria-labelledby` on the `combobox`)... But our solution is jank... we'll need to make notes about that.
- [ ] We may want to list out URLs that were helpful for us ... Such as the info on `delegatesFocus`. But even with `delegatesFocus`, we probably need to transfer IDs still ... because we want the screen readers to understand what's going on.
